# Project Labyrinth [View Live &#10555;](https://labyrinth-linnea-sofia.netlify.app/)

Create a text based game.
Build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

We used redux to store the current state of the game and thunks to wrap the API call and handle the response delay with a loading function

- The page is responsible
- Handles the response delay with a loading page showing an animation (Lottie).

If I had more time:
- Disable non optional buttons for each step in the game.
- Show a history of which steps the player has done, use Redux to store previous steps. And make it possible to go back in the game.
- Style each step individually based on the text-content.
- Create a visual represenation (drawing) of the labyrinth which updates for each step the user is taking.
